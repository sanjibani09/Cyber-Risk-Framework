# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Framework for Small Retail & Service Businesses

This project presents a simple and practical Cybersecurity Risk Assessment Framework designed for small retail and service businesses with 1–25 employees. It provides a step-by-step approach for identifying, assessing, and treating cybersecurity risks using beginner-friendly tools, checklists, and documentation.

## 📌 Project Overview

Small businesses often lack cybersecurity awareness, budget, and technical expertise. This framework helps them:

- Identify cyber threats and vulnerabilities
- Evaluate risks using a simple scoring model
- Create a risk register with priority levels
- Develop a treatment plan for improving security
- Implement basic low-cost security measures

This project includes a simulated case study performed for **Sweet Bean Café**, a small café to demonstrate the framework in action.
